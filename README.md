# CodeSnipets
Here are some programming code snipets on several languages i usually code.

Code presented here is from past code iterantions and not from current development cycles.

During coding i give preference on coding techniques that result on less memory usage, and less costly (timewise). Also applies to usage of OOP classes versus simpler strutures.
